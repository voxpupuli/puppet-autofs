# @summary Manages the autofs facility, optionally including configuring mount
#   points and maps.
#
# Autofs mount points and their corresponding maps can also be
# managed via separate autofs::mount, autofs::mapfile, and
# autofs::mapping resources.

# To use this module, simply declare it in your manifest.
# @example Declaring the autofs class
#    include autofs
#
# The module now supports the ability to not only enable autofs,
# but to also disable or uninstall it completely.
# @example Removing the package
#   class { 'autofs':
#     package_ensure => 'absent',
#   }
#
# @example Disable the autofs service
#   class { 'autofs':
#     service_ensure => 'stopped',
#     service_enable => false,
#   }
#
# @example using hiera with automatic lookup
#   ---
#   autofs::mounts:
#     home:
#       mount: '/home'
#       mapfile: '/etc/auto.home'
#       options: '--timeout=120'
#       order: 01
#   autofs::mapfiles:
#     '/etc/auto.home':
#       'mappings':
#         - key: '*'
#           options: 'user,rw,soft,intr,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,tcp,nfsvers=3,noacl'

#
# @param mounts the options with which to manage the autofs master map
# @option mounts [String] :mount The autofs mount point to be managed
# @option mounts [Integer] :order The relative order in which the mount point's
#   definition will appear in the master map
# @option mounts [String] :mapfile Name of the autofs map file for this mount point
# @option mounts [String] :options Mount options to be recorded for this mount point
#   in the master map
# @option mounts [String] :master Full path, including file name, to the master map
#   in which to manage this mount point
# @option mounts [String] :map_dir Full path, including file name, to the master map
#   drop-in directory in which to manage this mount's definition.  Relevant only when
#   :use_dir is set to true
# @option mounts [Boolean] :use_dir Whether to manage this mount via a file in the
#   master map's drop-in directory instead of directly in the master map
# @param mapfiles options with which to manage map files.
# @option mapfiles [String] path: Full path, including file name, to a
#   map file to manage.  Defaults to the key with which this value is associated.
# @option mapfiles [Array] mappings: an array of hashes defining specific, sun-format
#   mappings that should appear in this map file.  Each has a 'key', an option list in
#   string or array form, and a filesystem specification as expected by the 'mount'
#   command.
# @option mapfiles [Boolean] replace: whether to modify the map file if it already exists
# @param maps Deprecated.  Use the mapfiles parameter instead.
# @param package_ensure Determines the state of the package. Can be set to: installed, absent, lastest, or a specific version string.
# @param package_name Determine the name of the package to install. Should be covered by hieradata.
# @param package_source Determine the source of the package, required on certain platforms (AIX)
# @param service_ensure Determines state of the service. Can be set to: running or stopped.
# @param service_enable Determines if the service should start with the system boot. true
#   will start the autofs service on boot. false will not start the autofs service
#   on boot.
# @param service_name Determine the name of the service for cross platform compatibility
# @param auto_master_map Filename of the auto.master map for cross platform compatiblity
# @param map_file_owner owner of the automount map files for cross platform compatiblity
# @param map_file_group group of the automount map files for cross platform compatiblity
# @param reload_command In lieu of a service reload capability in Puppet, exec this command to reload automount without restarting it.
